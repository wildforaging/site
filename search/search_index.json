The fruit also supplies manganese at 29% DV, while other micronutrients are uniformly low in content (table). In 100 grams (3.5 ounces) reference amount, acerola fruit provides an exceptional content of vitamin C at some 20 times the Daily Value (DV) (table). Whereas the content of sugar, soluble solids and titratable acids increases, the vitamin C content decreases with the ripening process of the fruit. Therefore, the immature green fruit is harvested for industrial use of the vitamin C. Besides the high vitamin C content, acerola also contains phytonutrients like phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and carotenoids.</p>"},{"location":"Plants/barbados-cherry/#yield-and-harvest","title":"Yield and Harvest","text":"<p>Acerola flowers and fruits already in the first year after planting but increases its production in the following years, reaching up to 47 kg/per plant in the sixth year. The fruiting season usually extends from April to November. The fruits should be picked frequently, as they are not stored on the tree. Ripe fruit should be handled carefully to avoid bruising and should be utilized as soon as possible or frozen for later use. Semi-ripe fruit will usually keep for several days in the refrigerator. Pollination by wild insects increases the fruit yield.</p>"},{"location":"Plants/barbados-cherry/#how-to-grow-it","title":"How to Grow It","text":"<p>Plants can be set at any time of the year, but the best time is spring, just before the rainy season.

It prefers dry, well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and cannot endure temperatures lower than 30 \u00b0F/ -1 \u00b0C. Because of its shallow roots, it has very low tolerance to winds. Furthermore, a sufficient water supply is advantageous for good growth and maximum yields of large fruits.

The shell of the fruit is smooth and very thin. Its shelf life of 2\u20133 days at ambient temperature makes it highly perishable.

It has a similar root and stem system to others in the dicot family Asteraceae. After germinating, the roots progress into a tap root that grows vertically in the ground. The primary tissue of the apical meristems increases the length of the plant and the secondary roots of the lateral meristems give rise to the width. B. alba grows to a height of approximately five feet.</p> <p>The stem of B. alba plant emerges from the taproot, yet the bent stem at the base also has the ability to grow into roots at the lower nodes. Stems are mostly hairless and green to purplish in color. The vascular bundle provides nutrients throughout the plant, with the xylem transporting water from the roots and the phloem obtaining food from the leaves.</p> <p>Bidens alba leaves, which are simple on the opposite side and compound on the underneath, are 2\u201310 centimetres (1\u20134 in) long and 1.0\u20133.5 cm (3\u20448\u20131+3\u20448 in) wide. The underside leaf is hairy, and has toothed edges.[4] The leaves may be lobed, depending on the species. Some have teeth and some do not; each node produces two leaves along the stem.</p> <p>Each flowering head of B. alba, which is small, appears in radial symmetry. The flowers on this plant are depicted as daisy-like due to the larger white petals and the very small yellow flowers which are located at the end of the branches. Colors of the flower-heads of Bidens alba vary depending on the subspecies; some B. alba have yellow, tubular central blossoms and others may have flower-heads with white or cream petals (1.5 cm or 5\u20448 in long); eventually they form black linear seeds, yielding approximately 1200 seeds per plant.</p>"},{"location":"Plants/bidens-alba/#uses","title":"Uses","text":"<p>Bidens alba provide a nectar source for butterflies and honey-bees.</p> <p>Bidens is a nutrient dense wild plant, boasting a similar nutrient profile to kale - high in fiber and proteins, carotenes, folate, and magnesium.

It is one of several palm species that are sometimes used to make heart of palm salad. Heart of palm was commonly eaten by Native Americans. However, extracting the heart kills this species of palm, because the terminal bud is the only point from which the palm can grow, so without this bud, the palm is not able to replace old leaves and eventually dies.</p> <p>The cabbage-like terminal bud has been eaten as hearts of palm. The bristles on the sheaths of young leaves have been made into scrubbing brushes. The trunks have been used as wharf piles.
